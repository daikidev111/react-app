# What is this repo?
Go Movie is an application that allows a user to view a list of movies that includes information of title, description, rating, and release year. This list can be viewed either by movie title or genre.
It also allows a user to create, edit, and delete a movie. To do these operations, you must be logged in with a appropriate jwt token, which should be saved in the local storage.

Please note that this project does not have an intention of commercialization.

# What kind of folder does this repo contain?
This repo contains two main folders, which are go-movies and backend-app.
The go-movies folder represents the frontend part of the application, which is written in React. The backend-app folder represents the backend part of the application, which is written in Golang.
